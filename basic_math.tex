This is inline \(n\) or $n$ math symbol.
on its own line $$n$$
another way to do its own line \[n\]


We start with $n$ elemets and we continue to divide them in half 
leaving $\frac{n}{2}$ elements. 

the power can be written using caret symbol, for instance $n^n$ results in n to the power n nicely. 

The indices could be written using underscore, for instance $n_i$ makes i an index of n. 

$(\frac{n}{2})$

$\left(\frac{n}{2}\right)$\\

$[\frac{n}{2}]$
vs
$\left[\frac{n}{2}\right]$
